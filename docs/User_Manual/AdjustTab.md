## FREQUENCY ADJUST

The ``Frequency Adjust`` is a 4-way joystick.
The left and right buttons adjust the FM transmit frequency in 100KHz steps.
The up and down buttons provide 1MHz steps.

---

## AUDIO CONTROLS

The Audio Control group provides special audio functions.

### TEST TONES

Enable the ``Test Tone`` feature by moving the slide switch to the right side.
Normal audio content will be replaced by a pleasant tone sequence.
The test tones can be used to help quickly identify your transmitter on a radio receiver.

Test Tone mode also sends a RadioText message with runtime clock that is updated every five seconds.
The RadioText is formatted as follows:

`PIXELRADIO AUDIO TEST HH:MM:SS`

### AUDIO MUTE
Audio can be silenced by moving the ``Audio Mute`` slide switch to the right side.
The RF Carrier and RadioText are not affected.

## SAVE SETTINGS

Any changes can be saved as default "Power-Up" settings.
Press the ``Save Settings`` button to store ALL current settings.

>Note: The Test Tone cannot be set as a default setting.
